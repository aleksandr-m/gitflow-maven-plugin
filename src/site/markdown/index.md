# Git-Flow Maven Plugin
 
  The Maven plugin that supports various Git workflows, including Vincent Driessen's [successful Git branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) and [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).

  Currently a Java implementation of Git version control system [JGit](https://github.com/eclipse/jgit) doesn't support [`.gitattributes`](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Customizing-Git-Git-Attributes).

  This plugin runs Git and Maven commands from the command line ensuring that all Git features work properly.

  Supports Eclipse Plugin projects build with [Tycho](https://eclipse.org/tycho/).
